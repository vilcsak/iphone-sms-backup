Description
===========
Backup your iPhone SMS and iMessage text messages.

Works with iOS6 and iOS7.

(And, it continues to work with iOS5, if anyone still finds that useful...)

Why? 
---- 
Your iPhone stores a copy of all your SMS and iMessage text messages in a
sqlite database. But, if you want to view them all on your iPhone, it's not so
easy. Be prepared to do a lot of scrolling.

Or, you can you use `sms-backup.py` to backup all your messages in text
format, CSV format, or JSON, and then view them in the data viewer of your
choice.

Plus, `sms-backup.py` cleans up and allows you to transform your data, in
order to make your text messages easier to read.

Transformations possible with `sms-backup.py`:

  * Better date formatting.
  
  * Consistent formatting of phone numbers.
  
  * Replacement of phone numbers with names.

How?
----
Before running this script, you need to backup up your iPhone to your local
computer. Connect it with a USB cable and launch a backup through iTunes.

Even if your iPhone is set to automatically backup to iCloud, you can
still choose to "Manually Backup Up" within iTunes, which will do a one-time
backup to your computer, and then resume the automatic iCloud backups.

Each time you sync/backup your iPhone, the SMS sqlite db file is copied to
your computer. 

When you run `sms-backup.py`, it finds the backup db file, makes a temporary
copy of it, selects the text messages you want from the temporary copy, and
then exports them.

Examples
========

Notes on the Database
=====================
The discussion about the SMS/iMessage database has been moved to the project wiki:

  * https://github.com/toffer/iphone-sms-backup/wiki

Known Limitations
=================
  * Won't find the backup sqlite db on Windows, but it *should* run if you pass
    in the db name with --input.  (I haven't tested it, though...)

  * Assumes encoding of texts is 'utf-8'...and there's no way to change it.
    
  * Does not handle group chats.
